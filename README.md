# Break-through
Break-through Game in Java GUI

Break-through is a two-player game, played on a board consists of n x n fields. Each player has 2n
dolls in two rows, placed on at the player’s side initially (similarly to the chess game, but now every
dolls of a player look like the same). A player can move his doll one step forward or one step
diagonally forward (can’t step backward). A player can beat a doll of his opponent by stepping
diagonally forward onto it. A player wins when his doll reaches the opposite edge of the board.
Implement this game, and let the board size be selectable (6x6, 8x8, 10x10). The game should
recognize if it is ended, and it has to show in a message box which player won. After this, a new game
should be started automatically.
